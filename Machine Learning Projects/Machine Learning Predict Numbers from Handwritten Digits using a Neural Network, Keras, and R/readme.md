# Machine Learning:  Predict numbers from handwritten digits using a Neural Network and MNIST Data Set

The hands on project on Machine Learning:  Predict numbers from handwritten digits using a Neural Network and MNIST Data Set: is divided into following tasks:

Task 1: In this task the Learner will be introduced to the Course Objectives, which is to how to execute a Neural Network on the MNIST Data Set.  There will also be a short discussion about the Interface, loading packages, and an Instructor Bio.

Task 2:  The Learners will see what a Tensor looks like and then apply that knowledge to 60,000 hand written digits using Keras array_reshape() function.

Task 3: The Learner will then create a classifier using one hot encoding. 

Task 4: The Learner will then build out the architecture for the Neural Network.  Rectified Linear Unit ("RELU") and SoftMax will be used.  

Task 5: The Learner will then build out a loss optimizer function using cross_entropy.

Task 6: The Learner will test to see how the model performed using a Confusion Matrix.
