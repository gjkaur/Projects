## Data Balancing with Gen AI: Credit Card Fraud Detection

A financial institution, called SecureTrust Financial Services, has contracted us to improve the accuracy of their fraud detection machine learning model. The model is a binary classifier, but it is not working well because the data is imbalanced. To solve this problem as data scientists, we will use generative adversarial networks (GANs), a type of Generative AI, to generate synthetic fraudulent transactions that are indistinguishable from real transactions. This will help to balance the dataset and improve the accuracy of the fraud detection model.

Learning Objectives
- Load the Dataset
- Preprocess and Explore the data
- Create the Generator model
- Practice Task - Data Preprocessing for Neural Networks
- Create the Discriminator model
- Combine Generator and Discriminator models to Build The GAN
- Train and evaluate our GAN
- Generate synthetic data using the trained Generator
- Challenge Task - Principal Component Analysis for Data visualization

- Possible Approaches - Bagging, Boosting, Under-sampling, Over-sampling
- Project Goal: A balanced binary-labeled dataset of genuine and fraudulent transactions generated by Generative AI.
- Google Colab
